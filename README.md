# README Generator

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT%20License-blue.svg)

## Description
This command-line application generates a professional README.md file based on the userâ€™s inputs. The generated README.md file includes sections for a project description, table of contents, installation instructions, usage instructions, license information, contribution guidelines, tests, and where to go for questions. Having an application that generates README.md files will save users time by automating the process of creating a well-structured document that is appealing to potential application users and contributors.

This README generator was created using starter code from <a href="https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma">gachoi06</a>, which contained contributions from <a href="https://github.com/Xandromus">Xandromus</a>.

The displayed license badges are sourced from <a href="https://shields.io/category/license">Shields IO</a>.
