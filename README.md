# README Generator

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT%20License-blue.svg)

## Description
This command-line application generates a professional README.md file based on the userâ€™s inputs. The generated README.md file includes sections for a project description, table of contents, installation instructions, usage instructions, a license, contributing, tests, and questions. Having an application that generates README.md files will save users time by automating the process of creating a well-structured document that is appealing to potential application users and contributors.

This README.md generator was created using starter code from <a href="https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma">gachoi06</a>, with contributions from <a href="https://github.com/Xandromus">Xandromus</a>.
